# PayStation Main Program and Rate Strategies

## Requirements
- The requirements for this project involved implementing the main program to simulate the PayStation operation and implementing rate strategies for five different cities. We were able to implement all of the requirements.
- We used the compositional model to implement the rate strategies. We chose this model because it made our code readable and easy to make changes to rate policies while the system was running.
